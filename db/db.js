/*
  The db module provides a convenient way for services in chezbob to directly access the database.
  Note, that any service which does so, must be co-located on the server with the database.

  The db module selects which database to provide based on the DEPLOYMENT_MODE environment variable.

  As more services interface with the database, this module serves as a convenient place to implement
  shared functionality and common queries
